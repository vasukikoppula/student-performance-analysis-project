STUDENT PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS USING SVM CLASSIFIER

Improving the quality of teaching and students' academic performance is a key concern for educational institutions. 
To address this, I have introduced a system for analyzing future scores and reports, focusing on outcome-based learning.
This comprehensive Educational Data Mining (EDM) framework takes the form of a rule-based recommender system.
 It not only predicts student performance but also elucidates the underlying reasons. 
The proposed framework assesses students' demographic information, academic and psychological traits, extracting valuable insights from students, teachers, and parents. 
By leveraging robust data mining techniques, the system aims to achieve optimal accuracy in predicting academic performance. 
Furthermore, the framework identifies students' weaknesses and offers tailored recommendations for improvement.

This project can be run by following the steps:
-> Open Anaconda 3
-> Click on jupyter notebook
-> Open the file 'student-data-analysis.ipynb'
-> Run the file (including all tabs)
Make sure that the .csv and .ipynb file are in same folder to retrive the dataset in the model.
